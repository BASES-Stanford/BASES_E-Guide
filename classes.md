### EDUC

##### EDUC 224 Social Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation (AKA STRAMGT 367)  
  For: All
  An in depth course about Social-E and Social innovation, essentiually aoplying entreprenurial skills to help the worlds social problems with no intentions of making money. Examines individuals and organizations that use entrepreneurial skills and approaches to develop innovative responses to social problems. Entrepreneurship has traditionally been seen as a way of creating wealth for the entrepreneur and for those who back her/his work. Social entrepreneurs employ "entrepreneurial skills," such as finding opportunities, inventing new approaches, securing and focusing resources and managing risk, in the service of creating a social value. As the intensity and complexity of social and environmental problems has grown in recent years social entrepreneurship, defined as innovative, social value creating activity that can occur within or across the nonprofit, government or business sectors, has become increasingly prominent. While virtually all enterprises, commercial and social, generate social value, fundamental to this definition is that the primary focus of social entrepreneurship is to achieve social impact above all else. We will study some of the most promising and the best-proven innovations for improving people's lives. We will also examine mature projects that are now tackling the issue of "scale", moving from local innovations to solutions that create deep systemic changes for larger numbers of economically disadvantaged individuals and communities throughout the world. This year we will focus on what are the constraints and opportunities for creating a social enterprise at scale. nn nnThe process of "scale" poses tremendous challenges. Even when organizations manage to overcome the many obstacles to growth, and achieve appreciable scale, this approach is seldom sufficient to achieve significant social impact on its own. This year our course will pay particular attention to network approaches which require the mobilization of a vast array of actors and resources, but have the potential to generate rapid and sustained social impact.

##### EDUC 230X Social Enterprise (AKA STRAMGT 341):

Case studies. Student teams carry out field-based research in a significant strategic or operational issue of a social enterprise

##### EDUC 321X Leading Social Change: Educational and Social Entrepreneurship (AKA OB 385):
  For: All
The course provides an overview of different approaches to leading change in the social sector, drawing primarily, but not exclusively, on case examples in education. While there is a substantial need for innovation and visionary leadership in sectors such as education, social entrepreneurs who want to drive change must appreciate the significant barriers and unique opportunities presented by non-market forces in these sectors. The course will equip students with an appreciation for different mechanisms of change and theories of action as well as some of the challenges of initiating and sustaining meaningful change in social sectors such as education. nnThe course will draw on readings and case studies, and we will benefit from the wisdom of an inspirational group of guest lecturers. While the course will benefit any student concerned with making a positive impact in the world, it is particularly (although not exclusively) appropriate for students in the joint MA/MBA program as well as those who will lead social change through nonprofit consulting or entrepreneurship.

### ENGR

### FINANCE

##### FINANCE 373 Entrepreneurial Finance 
  For: All 
  This is a course about the financial decision-making process for start-up firms. The course takes a two-pronged approach: First, we develop tools and concepts of corporate finance related to modeling, valuation, control, and investment decisions within an entrepreneurial context. Second, we use cases with firms at different stages of their life cycle from initial angel or venture capital investments through exit decisions, to see the issues that arise when these principles are applied in practice. In some cases we take the viewpoint of the entrepreneur and in others the viewpoint of the investor. After all, as an entrepreneur, you cannot negotiate effectively without understanding the investor's motivations. Conversely, you cannot evaluate a potential investment opportunity without appreciating the entrepreneur's perspective and incentives. Finally, we explore new developments in entrepreneurial finance such as crowdfunding and early liquidity provision.
  Teachers:Shai Benjamin Bernstein, Arthur Korteweg 

### GSBGEN

##### GSBGEN 111Q Seminar in Entrepreneurial Communication:
For: All
College campuses have been the incubators for thousands of new business ventures. What makes the difference between a successful entrepreneur and an initial failure out of the gate? It's often not the quality of the idea, but rather the ability of the entrepreneurs to successfully communicate their vision to potential investors, employees, and customers. This seminar will explore successful and failed entrepreneurial communication. Students will learn the basics of persuasive oral and written communication, and then apply these principles to their own ideas.

##### GSBGEN 313 Advanced Seminar on Social Entrepreneurship and Global Poverty:
  For: All
As an "advanced" seminar, this course is designed for students with strong backgrounds or interests in social entrepreneurship as a tool for solving social problems. The learning format is based on active engagement. For most of the classes, students will be required to lead off the class discussions. The ultimate goal of this course is to make students (and the instructor) smarter about the strengths and limits of social entrepreneurship as a tool for social change. To this end, we will focus on global poverty reduction as a testing ground. During this process we will explore different theories, concepts, frameworks, and guidelines for effective social entrepreneurship to see whether, when and how these help. nnnThe course is organized into three modules. The first focuses on how social entrepreneurship fits in a broader framework of social change and social innovation. The second module provides a brief overview of issues, debates, and theories about poverty and development. The third module focuses on specific entrepreneurial interventions aimed at addressing some of the conditions that keep people poor or make them poor. nnnThis course allows us to dig into the complexities and challenges of effective social entrepreneurship. It will be taught in a discussion style. The reading will be demanding. So if you are not prepared to dig into the reading or to engage in active discussion, or if you don't feel like you bring relevant knowledge to add to the mix of discussion, this is not the course for you. It is not meant to be an introduction to social entrepreneurship. If everyone contributes, we will all emerge from the course with new perspectives and frameworks for advancing practice in this field. Only take this course if you are ready for an intellectual adventure and ready to make the investment
  Teacher: Greg Dees

##### GSBGEN 314 Creating High Potential Ventures in Developing Economies 
  For: All
This course addresses the distinctive challenges and opportunities of launching high-potential new ventures in developing economies. Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments.

### MKTG

##### MKTG 344 Marketing Research
  For: All (Unless GSB Grading means only GSB??)
  Market intelligence is of value to firms. To understand their markets, firms need to answer questions such as: How large is the market for a product, what is important for the target segment? How does change in the product design affect profits? This course aims to help students ask relevant questions and find data-driven answers to them. The main objectives are to equip students with: 1) an understanding of the value of data - what intelligence it can and cannot provide, 2) exposure to state-of-the-art quantitative tools such as conjoint analysis and cluster analysis to analyze the data, and 3) sufficient hands-on experience with these tools for answering students' own marketing research questions from the perspective of an entrepreneur, marketer or a consultant. The course is designed to address substantive marketing problems such as: market segmentation, targeting, forecasting demand, pricing, and developing new products. 
  Teachers:Navdeep Sahni

##### STRAMGT 353 Entrepreneurship: Formation of New Ventures 
  For: GSB Students
  This course is offered for students who at some time may want to undertake an entrepreneurial career by pursuing opportunities leading to partial or full ownership and control of a business. The 2013-14 spring quarter section, taught by Russ Siegelman and Laura Hattendorf, will exclusively focus on social ventures and is not recommended for students NOT interested in social ventures. The course deals with case situations from the point of view of the entrepreneur/manager rather than the passive investor. Many cases involve visitors, since the premise is that opportunity and action have large idiosyncratic components. Students must assess opportunity and action in light of the perceived capabilities of the individuals and the nature of the environments they face. The course is integrative and will allow students to apply many facets of their business school education. Each section will have a specific focus, please select the instructor(s) with your interests: Leslie, Siegelman - High tech ventures Ellis, Chambers, Childs - Diverse types of ventures Ellis, Foster - Diverse types of ventures Siegel, Brady - High tech emphasis, but diverse types of ventures Siegelman, Hattendorf - Social ventures Reiss, Chess - Very early stage ventures.

##### STRAMGT 354 Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital 
  For: GSB Students
  Many of America's most successful entrepreneurial companies have been substantially influenced by professionally managed venture capital. This relationship is examined from both the entrepreneur's and the venture capitalist's perspective. From the point of view of the entrepreneur, the course considers how significant business opportunities are identified, planned, and built into real companies; how resources are matched with opportunity; and how, within this framework, entrepreneurs seek capital and other assistance from venture capitalists or other sources. From the point of view of the venture capitalist, the course considers how potential entrepreneurial investments are evaluated, valued, structured, and enhanced; how different venture capital strategies are deployed; and how venture capitalists raise and manage their own funds. The course includes a term-long project where students work in teams (4-5 students per team) to write a business plan for a venture of the team's choosing.
  Teachers: Peter Wendell, P. Ziebelman, John Glynn

##### STRAMGT 356 The Startup Garage: Design:
  For: Grad Students
  Startup Garage is an intensive hands-on, project-based course, in which graduate students will apply the concepts of design thinking, engineering, finance, business and organizational skills to design and test new business concepts that address real world needs . Our aspiration is to help teams identify an unmet customer need, design new products or services that meet that need, and develop business models to support the creation and launch of startup products or services. Even those teams that do not successfully launch a venture, or individuals who decide not to move forward, will learn critical, cutting-edge techniques about starting and launching a venture. nnnCollaborative, multi-disciplinary teams will identify and work with users, domain experts, and industry participants to identify and deeply understand customer needs, then proceed to design products or services and a business model to address those needs .Each team will conceive, design, build, and field-test critical aspects of both the product or service and the business model. This course is offered by the Graduate School of Business. It integrates methods from human-centered design, lean startup, and business model planning. The course focuses on developing entrepreneurial skills (using short lectures and in-class exercises) and then applying these skills to specific problems faced by those users identified by the teams. Teams will get out of the building? and interact directly with users and advisors to develop a deep understanding of the challenges they face and to field test their proposed services, products, and business models.
