# Contribute to the E-Guide

Contributing to the BASES E-Guide is easy! The E-Guide is written in the Markdown format.

### Markdown:

Markdown (.md) is very similar to normal text (.txt) files. For a quick crash course on Markdown check out this fantastic [cheat sheet] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Editing a Page

1. Login or create a free GitHub account. 
2. Navigate to the page you want to edit and click "Edit" on the top right-hand side of the file viewer. 
3. Edit the page.
4. Commit your changes: Scroll down to the box that says "Commit changes". Give your commit a title and a short description, then press the green "Commit changes" button.

Once your change has been committed, give ~24 hours for the Tech Savant to approve and deploy the changes to the BASES website.
