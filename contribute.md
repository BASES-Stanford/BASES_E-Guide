# Contribute to the E-Guide

Contributing to the BASES E-Guide is easy! The E-Guide is written in the Markdown format.

### Markdown:

Markdown (.md) is a file format that is very similar to normal text (.txt) files. For a quick crash course on Markdown check out this [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Editing a Page


The best way to update the E-Guide is with the fork-and-pull model.  Contributing is the best way to ensure that your team's content gets onto the site as fast as possible, i.e. you can contribute without involving the Tech Savant until the very last step.

1. Login or create a free GitHub account. 
2. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
3. Navigate to the page you want to edit and click "Edit" on the top right-hand side of the file viewer. 
4. Edit the page.
5. Commit your changes. Scroll down to the box that says "Commit changes". Give your commit a title and a short description, then press the green "Commit changes" button.
6. [Submit a pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

Once your pull request has been submitted, please allow 24 hours for the Tech Savant to approve and deploy the changes to the BASES website.
