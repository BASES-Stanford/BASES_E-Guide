# Contribute to the E-Guide

Contributing to the BASES E-Guide is easy! The E-Guide is written in the Markdown format.

### Markdown:

Markdown (.md) is very similar to normal text (.txt) files. For a quick crash course in Markdown check out this [cheat sheet] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Editing a Page

1. Navigate to the page you want to edit and click "Edit" on the top right-hand side of the file viewer. 
2. Edit away!
3. Commit your changes: Scroll down to the box that says "Commit changes". Give your commit a title and a short description, then press the green "Commit changes" button.

### Questions?

If you have any questions or concerns about the E-Guide, please do not hesitate to email BASES Tech Savant Joseph Baena at jbaena@stanford.edu.
