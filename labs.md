###Stanford Labs

Stanford Technology Ventures Program (STVP)
  Focus: Technology based entrepreneurship
  Blurb: The Stanford Technology Ventures Program (STVP) is the entrepreneurship center at Stanford University's School of Engineering. STVP is hosted by the department of Management Science and Engineering. STVP's mission is dedicated to accelerating high-technology entrepreneurship education and creating scholarly research on technology-based firms that, in turn, provides new insights for students, scholars, and business leaders.

Aero Fluid Mechanics Laboratory
Focus: Basic studies of the fundamental properties of turbulent and reacting flow
Blurb: The Aero Fluid Mechanics Laboratory is interested in measurements of the structure of turbulent flames, direct numerical simulation of free shear flows, and use of topological methods for interpretation of complex three-dimensional vector fields. Recent projects include studies of fast-burning fuels for hybrid propulsion and decomposition of nitrous oxide for space propulsion.

Aerospace Robotics Laboratory
Focus: Improving robotic performance through the application of feedback control, integrated sensing systems, and task-level autonomy
Blurb: The Aerospace Robotics Laboratory is a research group in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. All of the research is developed and validated on experimental hardware systems. These systems include both mobile robots (land, sea, sky, and space) and a variety of fixed manipulators for space and factory applications.
