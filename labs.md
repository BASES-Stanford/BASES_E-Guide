# Labs at Stanford University

##### Aero Fluid Mechanics Laboratory
Blurb: The Aero Fluid Mechanics Laboratory is interested in measurements of the structure of turbulent flames, direct numerical simulation of free shear flows, and use of topological methods for interpretation of complex three-dimensional vector fields. Recent projects include studies of fast-burning fuels for hybrid propulsion and decomposition of nitrous oxide for space propulsion.
Led by: Director Brian Cantwell

##### Aerospace Robotics Laboratory
Blurb: The Aerospace Robotics Laboratory is a research group in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. All of the research is developed and validated on experimental hardware systems. These systems include both mobile robots (land, sea, sky, and space) and a variety of fixed manipulators for space and factory applications.
