###Startup Resources & Non-Student Organizations
GSB Entrepreneurship Club
(http://www.gsbeclub.org/startup-resources)

"The Stanford GSB Entrepreneur Club has been diligently collecting content that we believe is helpful to entrepreneurs launching their own startups.  We have attempted to organize the content in an intuitive manner that follows what we believe is a "startup roadmap".  Of course, entrepreneurship is unpredictable and full of exciting twists and turns, we do however believe that the items below are helpful in most cases."

US-Asia Technology Management Center 
Brief: The goal of US-ATMC educational programs is to provide Stanford students in various technical fields, and the science and engineering research community at large, with knowledge and analytical capabilities in our areas of focus that will be important to success in the Twenty-First Century. At the same time, the US-ATMC provides unique resources to Stanfordâ€™s research infrastructure for following and analyzing international trends in selected research areas. As part of our practical focus, the US-ATMC aims to promote meaningful interaction between the university and industry through an active outreach program of public events and Internet-based information exchange. US-ATMC activities include public lecture series and seminars (including live teleconferenced events between the U.S. and Asia), sponsorship of faculty research projects, development and delivery of new university courses, and major Internet web site projects.
